My Personal Portfolio Website project aims to create a basic yet functional portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website includes essential sections such as a homepage, an introduction section, and a projects section. The primary purpose of the website is to showcase the skills, projects, and provide a means for visitors to download the my CV and get in touch.
The main features of the website are as follows:

Home: This section serves as the landing page of the portfolio website. It provides an overview and introduction to myself, highlighting their professional background and areas of expertise.
Introduction: In this section, a concise description of the my background, skills, and technical proficiencies is provided. It gives visitors a brief overview of the owner's qualifications and experience.
Projects: The projects section showcases my previous projects. Each project is described with relevant details, and a link to the project's GitHub repository is provided. This allows visitors to explore the code and gain a deeper understanding of the owner's work.
Download CV: A link is provided for visitors to download the owner's curriculum vitae (CV). This enables interested parties to access the owner's detailed professional profile.
Contact: This link provides visitors with a means to get in touch with the owner. Contact information such as email address, phone number, or a contact form can be included to facilitate communication.

Future enhancements for the project include:
UI Improvements: Theproject intends to enhance the user interface by working on the color palette, design elements, and overall visual appeal of the portfolio website. This will create a more visually engaging and aesthetically pleasing experience for visitors.
Additional Sections: The owner plans to expand the website by incorporating additional sections such as achievements, academic details, certifications, or testimonials. This will provide a more comprehensive overview of the owner's accomplishments and further demonstrate their skills and expertise.
