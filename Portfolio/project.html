                    <h2>1) Today-I-Learned</h2>
                    <p>Today-I-Learned is an innovative project that aims to provide users with interesting and factual information in a user-friendly manner. The project utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to create an interactive platform where users can explore and contribute to a collection of facts. The main feature of the project is the display of facts along with their corresponding source links, ensuring transparency and credibility.To encourage user participation, Today-I-Learned incorporates a functionality for users to add their own facts. These facts are stored in a Supabase database, ensuring secure and efficient data management. By allowing users to contribute their own facts, the project fosters a collaborative environment and encourages the sharing of knowledge among users.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Furthermore, Today-I-Learned implements a voting system to gauge the interest and accuracy of the displayed facts. Users can vote on facts as either interesting, mind-blowing, or factually wrong. Based on the votes received, the facts are dynamically sorted from descending to ascending order. This means that facts with higher votes of interesting or mind-blowing are prioritized and displayed at the top, making it easier for users to explore the most captivating content.Additionally, the project incorporates a feature that highlights disputed facts. If a fact receives more votes as factually wrong, it is labeled as disputed. This helps maintain the integrity of the information presented and encourages users to engage in discussions regarding the accuracy of certain facts.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Today-I-Learned serves as a practical application for learning and gaining a better understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. By working on this project, you can enhance your knowledge and skills in these tech stacks while simultaneously providing a valuable resource for users to expand their knowledge and engage in intellectual discussions.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The future scope of the Today-I-Learned project includes the addition of a user authentication feature, which would enable users to sign up and sign in to the platform. This feature would enhance the project's functionality and provide personalized experiences for users.Furthermore, incorporating user authentication would enable users to vote for a fact only once. Currently, users can vote on facts, but there is no restriction on the number of votes they can cast. With user authentication, the system can enforce a rule that each user can only vote once on a particular fact. This ensures a fair and accurate representation of user opinions and prevents manipulation of the voting system.

                    <h2>2) Learn-Aid</h2>
                    <p>Learn Aid is a mobile application designed to connect individuals who have a passion for teaching and doing social good to NGOs and orphanages where children aged between 6-14 years require tutoring services. The app provides a platform for mentors to register and search for NGOs where they can offer their services. At the same time, the NGOs can register and search for mentors who can help them with specific subjects and classes.The app is built using Flutter, a popular mobile app development framework, and the data is stored using Firestore, a cloud-based NoSQL document database. The app features email authentication using Google Firebase, ensuring that only verified users can access the platform. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The app has many other functionalities, including a search feature that allows users to find NGOs and mentors quickly, and enables communication between mentors and NGOs directly through email and phone. The app also has the feature of Aadhar verification for the mentors for further verification.Learn Aid is an innovative solution that addresses the issue of the lack of educational support for children in orphanages and NGOs. By connecting mentors with these organizations, it provides children with access to quality education, which is essential for their growth and development. The app also provides mentors with an opportunity to contribute to society by using their skills and knowledge to teach children who are in need of educational support.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The app's structure is straightforward, with three main user roles: mentors, NGOs, and administrators. Mentors can create profiles highlighting their skills and experience, search for NGOs that need their services, and communicate with them via the in-app messaging system. NGOs, on the other hand, can create profiles that highlight the specific needs of their organization, search for mentors who can provide the necessary tutoring services, and communicate with them via the app's messaging system. Administrators have access to all user accounts and can manage the app's functionality and features.The app's utility is vast, and it has the potential to revolutionize the way tutoring services are provided to children in need. The app's primary focus is on children aged between 6-14 years, a critical age group that requires a solid foundation in various subjects to succeed in life. Learn Aid provides a platform that can connect these children with passionate mentors who can help them achieve their goals.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In terms of future scope, Learn Aid can add several features to enhance the app's functionality and user experience. For example, the app can include a feature that allows mentors to track their progress and the progress of the children they are tutoring. The app can also add a feature that allows NGOs to generate reports on the impact of the tutoring services they receive. Finally, Learn Aid can expand its user base beyond NGOs and orphanages and include schools and other organizations that require tutoring services.In conclusion, Learn Aid is an innovative and useful app that addresses the issue of educational support for children in orphanages and NGOs. By connecting mentors with these organizations, it provides children with access to quality education, while also providing mentors with an opportunity to contribute to society. The app has immense potential for expansion and can be a game-changer in the field of social development.
